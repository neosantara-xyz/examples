# AI-Powered Event Invitation Workflow

An automated multi-agent system for generating personalized **event invitations** using [AG2 (Formerly AutoGen)](https://ag2.ai/) and [Neosantara AI](https://neosantara.xyz). This workflow processes guest data, creates customized invitations in multiple languages with varying formality levels, and validates the generated content.

## Overview

This project automates the entire invitation generation process:
1. **Profiling**: Reads guest data from CSV and converts it to structured JSON
2. **Drafting**: Generates personalized invitations for each guest based on their preferences
3. **Validation**: Ensures all invitations contain required information and meet quality standards

## Build with AG2

This project is built with [AG2 (Formerly AutoGen)](https://ag2.ai/) and utilizes the following features from the library:

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinates specialized agents (Profiler, Drafter, Validator) to handle different workflow stages
2. **GroupChat & GroupChatManager**: Orchestrates agent conversations with custom state transitions for sequential workflow execution
3. **AssistantAgent**: Create AI-powered agents using  for code generation, content creation, and validation
4. **UserProxyAgent**: Manages user interactions and workflow initiation
5. **LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor**: Executes Python code generated by agents in a sandboxed environment
6. **Custom Speaker Selection**: Uses `speaker_selection_method` with state transitions to control workflow logic
7. **Termination Conditions**: Implements custom termination logic to end group chats at appropriate stages

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, Neosantara AI API Key ([Get one here](https://app.neosantara.xyz/api-keys))

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/neosantara-xyz/examples
cd examples/ag2/event_invitation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set API key
export NAI_API_KEY="your_neosantara_api_key" # or set on .env file
```

## Running the Code

```bash
python main.py
```

**Output:** The workflow generates:
- `result/profiles.json` - Structured guest data
- `result/invitation_{id}.md` - Personalized invitations
- `result/validation_report.json` - Quality assurance report

## Configuration

### API Configuration

The project uses the Neosantara AI API ([grok-4-fast](https://www.neosantara.xyz/model/grok-4-fast)). To use a different Model:

1. Modify the `config_list` in `main.py`:
```python
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "kimi-k2", # see https://www.neosantara.xyz/models
        "base_url": "https://api.neosantara.xyz/v1",
        "api_key": os.environ.get("NAI_API_KEY"),
        "api_type": "openai",
    }
]
```

### Event Details

To customize the event information, modify the event details in the Drafter's message:

```python
message = f"""Generate a personalized invitation text for the following guest:
...
The event is the "Your Event Name" on [Date], at [Venue].
"""
```
